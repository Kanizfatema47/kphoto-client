                                Authentication is the process of verifying who someone is, whereas authorization is the process of verifying what specific applications, files, and data a user has access to. Authentication needs usually user's login details. While authorization process is done after the authentication process.                              </div>

It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
